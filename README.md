# An Empirical Study on Bugs inside TensorFlow
## Project summary
In this paper, we conduct an empirical study to analyze the bugs inside a typical deep learning library, \emph{i.e.}, Tensorflow. Based on our results, we summarize seven findings, and present our answers to four research questions. For example, we find that the symptoms and root causes of Tensorflow bugs are more like a traditional project (\emph{e.g.}, Mozilla) than a machine learning library (\emph{e.g.}, OpenNLP). As another example, we find that most Tensorflow bugs reside in its interfaces (26.24\%), learning algorithms (11.79\%), and how to compile (8.02\%), deploy (7.55\%), and install (4.72\%) Tensorflow across platforms.
In this project, we analyzed 93,643 methods of 9 popular API libraries. The results are reported in our submitted paper.
